Systematic strategy we'll apply for solveing problems
- State the problem clearly. Identify the inputs and outputs formats. 
- Come up with some example inputs and outputs. Try to cover all edge cases
- Come up with a correct solution andt test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any
- Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any
- Apply the rigth technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.

Complexity
- Big O Notation: cN^3 + dN^2 + eN + f -> O(N^3)
- Time complexity
- Space complexity


Recommendations
- Name your function appropiately and think carefully about the signature
- Discudd the problem with the interviewer if you are unsure how to frame it in abstract terms
- Use descriptive variable names, otherwise you may forget what a variable represents

1. Alice has some cards whit numbers written on then. She arranges the cards in decreasing order, and lays then out face down in a sequence on a table. She challenges Bob to pick out the card  containing a given number by turning over as few cards as possible. Write a function to help Bob locate the card
